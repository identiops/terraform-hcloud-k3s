# Private k3s Kubernetes Terraform installer for Hetzner Cloud

This Terraform module creates a Kubernetes Cluster on
[Hetzner Cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) infrastructure running Ubuntu
24.04. The module aims to be simple to use while providing an out-of-the-box
secure and maintainable setup. Thanks to Ubuntu's LTS version we get up to 5
years of peace and quiet before having to upgrade the cluster's operating
system!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

WARNING: Apple Silicon is apparently not supported by important terraform
modules, see <https://github.com/identiops/terraform-hcloud-k3s/issues/19>.

- [Terraform](https://terraform.io) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/). Note
  that you'll need Terraform v1.0 or newer to run this project.
- `bash` for executing the generated scripts.
- `jq` for executing the generated scripts.
- `kubectl` for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.
- `ssh` for connecting to cluster nodes.

### Recommended Tools

- [Ansible cli](https://www.ansible.com/) for executing commands simultaneously
  on multiple cluster nodes.
- [Cilium cli](https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli) for verifying and
  interacting with the Kubernetes networking layer.
- [Helm cli](https://helm.sh/) for installing and updating components inside the
  cluster.

### Installation

1. Create a Hetzner Cloud API token.
   - Register with [Hetzner Cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud).
   - Create a new project.
   - Navigate to the security settings.
   - Select the "API tokens" tab and add a new token with **read & write**
     access and a second token with just **read** access.

![API Token Generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/identiops/terraform-hcloud-k3s/main/figures/hetzner_api_token.png)

2. Store Hetzner Cloud API token locally. Either, pass the tokens to terraform
   via an environment variable or create a file called `terraform.tfvars`:

```bash
# Either, enter your Hetzner Cloud API Token (it will be hidden)
read -sp "Hetzner Cloud API Token: " TF_VAR_hcloud_token
export TF_VAR_hcloud_token
read -sp "Hetzner Cloud API read only Token: " TF_VAR_hcloud_token_read_only
export TF_VAR_hcloud_token_read_only

# Or store the token in terraform.tfvars
touch terraform.tfvars
chmod 600 terraform.tfvars
cat >terraform.tfvars <<EOF
hcloud_token = "XYZ"
hcloud_token_read_only = "ABC"
EOF
```

3. Download
   [`examples/1Region_3ControlPlane_3Worker_Nodes/main.tf`](https://github.com/identiops/terraform-hcloud-k3s/blob/main/examples/1Region_3ControlPlane_3Worker_Nodes/main.tf):
   `curl -LO https://github.com/identiops/terraform-hcloud-k3s/raw/main/examples/1Region_3ControlPlane_3Worker_Nodes/main.tf`
4. Adjust the cluster configuration in `main.tf`, e.g.
   - `cluster_name`
   - `default_location`
   - `k3s_version`
   - `ssh_keys` (to create a new ssh key run: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`)
   - `node_pools`
5. For multi-region deployments, there are a few things to consider:
   - It is recommended to distribute the control plane nodes across multiple
     regions. If 3 control plane nodes shall be used, create 3 node pools and
     configure a different `location` for each pool.
   - etcd's default configuration expects a low-latency local network. When
     distributing nodes across multiple regions, latency will increase. The
     timing parameters therefore need to be adjusted, see
     [etcd Tuning](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/tuning/#time-parameters). Set
     `control_plane_k3s_additional_options`, e.g. to
     `--etcd-arg=heartbeat-interval=120 --etcd-arg=election-timeout=1200`
     Measurements between Falkenstein, Nuremberg and Helsinki: I measured a
     latency of 0.7ms (within Nuremberg region), 3ms (Nuremberg -> Falkenstein),
     and 24ms (Nuremberg -> Helsinki).
   - Hetzner doesn't support mounting volumes on servers in another region! The
     most simple setup is to just distribute the control plane nodes across
     multiple regions, disable the scheduling of workloads on control plane
     nodes and keep all worker nodes pools within one region. For better
     availability of workloads, worker node pools should be distributed across
     regions. This requires a configuration of
     [taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)
     and
     [node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/)
     to ensure that pods with volumes are schedules in the correct region.
   - Depending on the selected server regions the `network_zone` setting should
     be adjusted.
   - Hetzner's load balancers are bound to one region. Therefore, a
     multi-regional cluster with one load balancer is not sufficent for dealing
     with zone outages. The load balancer would go down with the region it's
     hosted in. If a protection against zone outages is required, a global load
     balancer should be deployed elsewhere, as
     [described by Google](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/load-balancing-overview).
6. Initialize the configuration: `terraform init`
7. Apply the configuration: `terraform apply`
8. Grab a coffee and enjoy the servers popping up in Hetzner's cloud console.
   Wait for about 5 minutes.

![Servers overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/identiops/terraform-hcloud-k3s/main/figures/hetzner_servers.png)

9. Test SSH access to the cluster: `./ssh-node cluster`
   - ATTENTION: don't hammer the cluster with failing SSH requests, or you'll be
     banned by your cluster automatically! If the request fails, because the
     cluster node isn't ready yet, wait another minute.
10. Once SSH connection is established, double check that everything is working
    as expected:
    - Did the node initialization finish successfully? `cloud-init status`
    - Is the cluster up and running? `kubectl cluster-info`
11. If the tests were successful, retrieve the Kubernetes configuration and
    store it locally: `./setkubeconfig`
12. Forward the cluster port locally since it's not exposed to the Internet by
    default. Do this every time you want to interact with the cluster:
    `./ssh-node gateway`
13. **On your local machine** test cluster access: `kubectl get nodes`

Enjoy your new cluster! 🚀

![k9s CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/identiops/terraform-hcloud-k3s/main/figures/k9s.png)

### Usage

Start using your favorite Kubernetes tools to interact with the cluster. One of
the first steps usually involves
[deploying an ingress controller](#add-ingress-controller-and-load-balancer)
since this configuration doesn't ship one.

In addition, a few convenience scripts were created to help with maintenance:

- `setkubeconfig`: retrieves and stores the Kubernetes configuration locally.
- `unsetkubeconfig`: removes the cluster from the local Kubernetes
  configuration.
- `ls-nodes`: lists the nodes that are part of the cluster for access via
  `ssh-node` and `scp-node`.
- `ssh-node`: SSH wrapper for connecting to cluster nodes.
- `scp-node`: SCP wrapper for connecting to cluster nodes.
- `.ssh/config`: SSH configuration for connecting to cluster nodes.
- `.ansible/hosts`: Ansible hosts configuration for executing commands on
  multiple nodes in parallel.

## Maintenance

### Access Kubernetes API via Port-Forwarding from Gateway

By default, the Kubernetes API port is not exposed on the internet, see option
`gateway_firewall_k8s_open`. Therefore, it is required to forward the Kubernetes
API port `6443` from the gateway.

A limited account `kubeapi` was created on the gateway that restricts SSH keys
configured via option `ssh_keys_kubeapi` to forward the single port. A
corresponding SSH config entry is created. The following command connects to the
gateway with the restricted user account:

```bash
./ssh-node kubeapi
```

With the established connection and a proper `KUBECONFIG`, the cluster can be
accessed:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Ansible: Execute Commands on Nodes

This module automatically generates an
[Ansible inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#connecting-to-hosts-behavioral-inventory-parameters)
in file `.ansible/hosts`. It can be leveraged to interact with the nodes and
node pools of the cluster.

Example: Execute a command on all control plane nodes

```bash
ANSIBLE_INVENTORY="$PWD/.ansible/hosts" ansible all_control_plane_nodes -a "kubectl cluster-info"
```

### Add Ingress Controller and Load Balancer

Since this module doesn't ship an ingress controller, one of the first
configurations applied to the cluster is usually an ingress controller. Good
starting points for an ingress controller are:

- [traefik](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/traefik/traefik)
- [ingress-nginx](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx)

The ingress controller, like the rest of the cluster, is not directly exposed to
the Internet. Therefore, it is necessary to add a load balancer that is directly
exposed to the Internet and has access to the local network of the cluster. The
load balancer is added to the cluster simply by adding annotations to the
ingress controller's service. Hetzner's Cloud Controller Manager will use the
annotations to deploy and configure the load balancer.

The following annotations should be used:

- Resource name: `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/name: "ingress-lb"`
- Protocol, just `tcp` - the ingress controller will take care of the HTTP
  connection: `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/protocol: "tcp"`
- Location, same as the one used for the cluster:
  `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/location: "nbg1"`
- Connection to the servers, must be set to `true`:
  `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/use-private-ip: "true"`
- Size, see [options](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/load-balancers/overview):
  `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/type: "lb11"`
- See
  [list of all supported Load Balancer Annotations](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager/blob/main/internal/annotation/load_balancer.go).

Furthermore, for domain names to work, it is required to point DNS records to
the IP address of load balancer.
[external-dns](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/external-dns/external-dns)
is a helpful tool that can automate this task from within the cluster. For this
to work well with Ingress resources, the ingress controller needs to
[expose the published service information](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/v0.14.0/faq/#which-service-and-ingress-controllers-are-supported)
on the Ingress resources.

### Add Nodes or Node Pools

The number of nodes in a node pool can be increased at any point. Just increase
the count and apply the new configuration via `terraform apply`. After a few
minutes the additional nodes will appear in the cluster.

In the same way, node pools can be added to the configuration without any
precaution.

### Remove Nodes or Node Pools

Removing nodes requires the following steps:

1. Identify the nodes and node pools that shall be removed. If the number of
   nodes in a node pool needs to be decreased, the nodes will be removed from
   the highest to the lowest number. Example: when the number of nodes in pool
   `system` is decreased from `3` to `2`, node `cluster-system-02` will be
   removed and nodes `cluster-system-01` and `cluster-system-00` will remain.
2. Drain all nodes that will be removed of pods:
   `kubectl drain cluster-system-02`
3. Wait until all pods have been migrated to other nodes before continuing.
   - If you drained the wrong node, you can reactivate the node with:
     `kubectl uncordon cluster-system-02`
4. Update the terrafrom configuration and apply it: `terraform apply`
   - Review the plan to verify that the drained nodes will be deleted.
5. Delete nodes from cluster: `kubectl delete node cluster-system-02`

### Stop Automated Node Reboots

Nodes are rebooting automatically when they receive updates that require a
reboot. The kured service triggers reboots of nodes one by one. Reboots can be
disabled system-wide by annotating the Daemonset, see
<https://kured.dev/docs/operation/>.

### Upgrade Operating System

An operating system update is not recommended, e.g. from Ubuntu 22.04 to 24.04.
Instead, the corresponding nodes should be replaced!

#### Gateway Node

1. Set new image as `default_image`. Attention: before changing the default
   image, make sure that each node pool has its own appropriate `image` setting.
2. Delete the node in the [Hetzner Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
3. Reapply the configuration: `terraform apply`

The gateway will reappear again within a few minutes. This will disrupt the
Internet access of the cluster's nodes for tasks like fetching package updates.
However, it will not affect the services that are provided via load balancers!

After redeploying the gateway, ssh connections will fail because a new
cryptographic has been generated for the node. Delete the deprecated key from
the `.ssh/known_hosts` file, open a new ssh connection and accept the new public
key.

#### Node Pools

Nodes should not be updated manually via `agt-get`, but be replaced. For control
plane nodes, it is recommended to create a back-up of the etcd data store on an
external s3 storage, see [k3s Cluster Datastore](https://docs.k3s.io/datastore).

1. For control plane pools only: Create a new etcd snapshot, see
   [k3s etcd-snapshot](https://docs.k3s.io/cli/etcd-snapshot).
2. Then, perform the following steps on consecutively on all existing node pools
   until they have all been replaced.

Start the replacement with the node pool with the `cluster_can_init` setting:

3. Ensure that there's another control plane node pool. If there's no other
   control plane node pool, create a temporary one that is deleted after the
   successful replacement of the node pool with the `cluster_can_init` setting.
4. When the second control plane node pool is up and running, the node pool with
   the `cluster_can_init` setting must be deleted and replaced in one
   application of the configuration.
   - Ensure that the `cluster_init_action.init` and `cluster_init_action.reset`
     settings are disabled.
   - Drain the old nodes: `kubectl drain node-xyz`
   - Once all pods have been migrated, delete the old nodes:
     `kubectl delete node node-xyz`
   - Then rename the node pool to achieve deletion and replacement in one
     configuration change.
   - Apply the configuration: `terraform apply`
   - Once the new control plane node pool with the `cluster_can_init` setting is
     again up and running, the temporary control plane node pool can be deleted.

Perform these steps for all remaining node pools:

5. Add a new node pool and set the `image` setting to the new version.
6. Once the new node pool is up and running, drain the old nodes:
   `kubectl drain node-xyz`
7. Once all pods have been migrated, delete the old nodes:
   `kubectl delete node node-xyz`
8. Remove the node pool from the terraform configuration.
9. Reapply the configuration: `terraform apply`

### Update Kubernetes

1. Determine the next Kubernetes version, see
   [k3s channels](https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels),
   [k3s images tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/rancher/k3s/tags), and
   [k3s upgrade image tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/rancher/k3s-upgrade/tags).
2. Write the upgrade plan, see
   [instructions](https://docs.k3s.io/upgrades/automated) and
   [examples](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller#example-plans).
3. Apply an upgrade plan.
4. Update the `image` variable in the configuration for future nodes to be
   deployed with the correct image.

Example upgrade plan:

### Update System Upgrade Controller

- Available versions:
  <https://github.com/rancher/charts/tree/dev-v2.10/charts/system-upgrade-controller>
- Update instructions: <https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller>

```bash
helm repo add rancher https://charts.rancher.io
helm repo update
helm upgrade --reuse-values system-upgrade-controller rancher/system-upgrade-controller -n cattle-system --version '<NEW_VERSION>'
```

`values.yaml`:

```yaml
# Documentation: https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller
# Documentation: https://github.com/rancher/charts/tree/release-v2.8/charts/system-upgrade-controller

systemUpgradeJobTTLSecondsAfterFinish: 86400 # retain jobs for 1 day for inspection purposes
```

## Deletion

After applying the Terraform plan you'll see several output variables like the
load balancer's, control plane's, and node pools' IP addresses.

```bash
terraform destroy -force
```

Be sure to clean up any CSI created Block Storage Volumes, and CCM created
LoadBalancers that you no longer require.

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway

Ensure gateway is set up correctly: `./ssh-node gateway`

#### Verify packet masquerading is set up properly

```bash
iptables -L -t nat

# Expected output:
# Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
# target     prot opt source               destination
#
# Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
# target     prot opt source               destination
#
# Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
# target     prot opt source               destination
#
# Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
# target     prot opt source               destination
# MASQUERADE  all  --  10.0.1.0/24          anywhere
```

#### Verify firewall is set up properly

```bash
ufw status

# Expected output:
# Status: active
#
# To                         Action      From
# --                         ------      ----
# 22,6443/tcp                ALLOW       Anywhere
# 22,6443/tcp (v6)           ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
#
# Anywhere on eth0           ALLOW FWD   Anywhere on enp7s0
# Anywhere (v6) on eth0      ALLOW FWD   Anywhere (v6) on enp7s0
```

### Nodes

#### Inspect local firewall settings

```bash
ufw status
```

#### Verify correctness of date/timezone and locale

```bash
date

echo $LANG
```

#### Inspect cloud-init logs

```bash
# Retrieve status
cloud-init status

# Verify configuration
cloud-init schema --system

# Collect logs for inspection
cloud-init collect-logs
tar xvzf cloud-init.tar.gz
# Inspect cloud-init.log for error messages

# Quickly find runcmd
find /var/lib/cloud/instances -name runcmd
sh -ex PATH_TO_RUNCMD
```

### Cluster

Ensure cluster is set up correctly: `./ssh-node cluster`

#### Verify default route

```bash
ip r s

# Expected output:
# default via 10.0.0.1 dev enp7s0 proto static onlink <-- this is the important line
# 10.0.0.0/8 via 10.0.0.1 dev enp7s0 proto dhcp src 10.0.1.2 metric 1024
# 10.0.0.1 dev enp7s0 proto dhcp scope link src 10.0.1.2 metric 1024
# 169.254.169.254 via 10.0.0.1 dev enp7s0 proto dhcp src 10.0.1.2 metric 1024
```

#### Verify connectivity to the Internet

```bash
ping 1.1.1.1

# Expected output:
# PING 1.1.1.1 (1.1.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
# 64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=4.60 ms
# 64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=6.82 ms
# ...
```

#### Verify name resolution

```bash
host k3s.io

# Expected output:
# k3s.io has address 185.199.108.153
# k3s.io has address 185.199.110.153
# k3s.io has address 185.199.111.153
# k3s.io has address 185.199.109.153
# ...
```

#### Verify cluster status

```bash
k3s kubectl get nodes

# Expected output:
# k3s.io has address 185.199.108.153
# k3s.io has address 185.199.110.153
# k3s.io has address 185.199.111.153
# k3s.io has address 185.199.109.153
# ...
```

#### Verify Cilium Networking Status

This command only works after installing the
[cilium cli](https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli).

- [cilium cli](https://www.klarmobil.de/)

```bash
cilium status

# Expected output:
#     /¯¯\
#  /¯¯\__/¯¯\    Cilium:             OK
#  \__/¯¯\__/    Operator:           OK
#  /¯¯\__/¯¯\    Envoy DaemonSet:    disabled (using embedded mode)
#  \__/¯¯\__/    Hubble Relay:       disabled
#     \__/       ClusterMesh:        disabled
#
# Deployment             cilium-operator    Desired: 1, Ready: 1/1, Available: 1/1
# DaemonSet              cilium             Desired: 3, Ready: 3/3, Available: 3/3
# Containers:            cilium             Running: 3
#                        cilium-operator    Running: 1
# Cluster Pods:          9/9 managed by Cilium
# Helm chart version:    1.14.5

```

#### Verify k3s Cluster Configuration

This command only works out of the box on the first node of the control plane
node pool with the `cluster_can_init` setting.

```bash
k3s check-config

# Expected output:
# ...
# STATUS: pass
```

#### Inspect cluster status and logs

```bash
systemctl status k3s.service

journalctl -u k3s.service
```
